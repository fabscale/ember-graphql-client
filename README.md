# ember-graphql-client

Packages to work with a minimal GraphQL client in Ember apps, including easy to use caching.

## Using GraphQL in your app

- Install `@ember-graphql-client/client`: `ember install @ember-graphql-client/client`
- Configure your API
- Use `graphql.query()` and `graphql.mutate()` in your app

## Using a mocked GraphQL API

If you need a mocked API, either for tests or for development/demo purposes, you can also do that:

- Install `@ember-graphql-client/mock`: `ember install @ember-graphql-client/mock`
- Configure your resolvers and enable the mock
